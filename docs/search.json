    "text": "Class exercises\nClass exercise 1: Examine the temperature visualization in the original NYT article.\n\nData storytelling: Relate the intro paragraph (“Scientists declared that 2015 was Earth’s hottest year on record…”) to the design of the visualization: Based on the intro paragraph, what key message/claim does NYT want readers to be able to explore? How did this goal inform what information is displayed in the visualization?\nTechnical implementation: What specific variables (from the codebook) underlie the visualization, and how do they map to visual elements (e.g., position, size, shape, and color of the glyphs)?\n\n\nWe can explore the “Geoms” section of the ggplot2 reference page to find a geom that corresponds to the visual elements in the temperature plot.\nClass exercise 2: Using both the small example visuals on the right and the names of the geom’s, brainstorm some possibilities for geom’s we might use to recreate the temperature visualization.\n\nWe need to explore further by opening up the geom reference pages to understand if a particular geom is suitable for our task. We’ll look at the geom_point documentation page to learn the process for reading a documentation page.\nWhen looking at a help page, it is useful to first look at the Usage and Arguments sections.\nThe Usage section shows all of the possible inputs (arguments) to the geom–these are all of the ways that a geom can be customized. Just looking at the argument names can help give a hint as to what arguments might fit our needs.\nThe Arguments section explains in detail what each argument does and the possible values the argument can take. The mapping, data, and ... arguments will be the most commonly used by far.\n\nmapping: This is the argument that is being used when you specify a plots aesthetics (the code inside aes()).\ndata: This is where you specify the dataset containing the variables that the geom is using.\n...: You will tend to use this for fixed aesthetics (ones that don’t correspond to a variable). For example, this is where you can set the color of all points (e.g., with color = \"red\") or the size of all points (e.g., with size = 3).\n\nA note about the data argument: Previously you have used one dataset per plot by specifying that as the first argument of ggplot(). For example, the code below makes a scatterplot of price vs. carat in the diamonds dataset, and the only data argument is in ggplot() (none in geom_point()).\n\ndata(diamonds)\nhead(diamonds)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 10\n  carat cut       color clarity depth table price     x     y     z\n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;ord&gt;     &lt;ord&gt; &lt;ord&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1  0.23 Ideal     E     SI2      61.5    55   326  3.95  3.98  2.43\n2  0.21 Premium   E     SI1      59.8    61   326  3.89  3.84  2.31\n3  0.23 Good      E     VS1      56.9    65   327  4.05  4.07  2.31\n4  0.29 Premium   I     VS2      62.4    58   334  4.2   4.23  2.63\n5  0.31 Good      J     SI2      63.3    58   335  4.34  4.35  2.75\n6  0.24 Very Good J     VVS2     62.8    57   336  3.94  3.96  2.48\n\nggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Note that we can make the same plot by specifying the argument names explicitly:\nggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    theme_classic()\n\nSometimes we may want to use more than one dataset in a plot. For example, we have a separate dataset that contains average prices of diamonds by carat:\n\nhead(diamonds_avg_price)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  carat avg_price\n  &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1  0.2       365.\n2  0.23      486.\n3  0.26      551.\n4  0.29      601.\n5  0.32      720.\n6  0.35      801.\n\n\nWe can use this separate diamonds_avg_price dataset in the geom_point() layer to add average price information to our scatterplot:\n\nggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    geom_point(data = diamonds_avg_price, aes(x = carat, y = avg_price), color = \"deepskyblue\", size = 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Aesthetics section of a geom documentation page gives information on how the visual elements of the geom correspond to data. For example, the geom_point documentation page shows that the familiar x and y aesthetics are available. It also shows some new aesthetics like stroke.\nWe can use the same process to look at the geom_linerange documentation page and start off our temperature visualization with the record lows and highs:\n\nggplot(weather) +\n    geom_linerange(aes(x = dateInYear, ymin = RecordLow, ymax = RecordHigh), color = \"#ECEBE3\", linewidth = 1.5) +\n    theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeyboard shortcuts\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you work on this plot, try to use some new keyboard shortcuts. Focus on the following:\n\nInsert code chunk: Ctrl+Alt+I (Windows). Option+Command+I (Mac).\nRun current code chunk: Ctrl+Shift+Enter (Windows). Command+Shift+Return (Mac).\nRun current line/currently selected lines: Ctrl+Enter (Windows). Command+Return (Mac).\n\n\n\n\nClass exercise 3: Add to your temperature visualization to also display the usual temperatures (NormalLow and NormalHigh), and actual 2011 temperatures (Low and High). Your plot should look like the one below. The tan color for the usual temperatures is \"#C8B8BA\", and the red color for the actual temperatures is \"#A90248\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s now try to recreate the visual demarcations of the months by adding vertical lines separating the months.\nClass exercise 4: Brainstorm with your groups how we might draw those vertical lines. What geom might we use? What subset of the data might we use in that geom layer to draw lines only at the month divisions? One person from your group should write your ideas on the board.\nOnce ideas are up on the board, we’ll work through this together as a class.\n\nNow let’s change the x-axis labels so that the month names display in the center of each month’s slice of the plot. (Note that R has built-in variables called month.abb and month.name that contain abbreviated and full month names.)\nClass exercise 5: We will explore two different approaches to figuring out this new challenge: Google search and AI.\n\nGoogle: Start by just using Google search queries. Collaborate with your group to try to word your search queries as carefully as possible (using the jargon that is most likely to return the most relevant results). Record search queries and your thought process in selecting which search results to look at first.\nAI: Next use ChatGPT. Collaborate with your group to brainstorm a series of prompts that will most efficiently get you the desired results. Record the chat prompts used and output given. Evaluate the output. Do you fully understand the code generated? How can you tell that the generated code is correct?\n\nAfter we debrief on these approaches, we’ll finalize this part of the plot together."

    "text": "File paths\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are file paths?\n\n\n\nA file path is a text string that tells a computer how to navigate from one location to another. We use file paths to read in (and write out) data.\nEssentially, file paths are what go inside read_csv().\n\n\nThere are two types of paths: absolute and relative.\nAbsolute file paths start at the “root” directory in a computer system. Examples:\n\nMac: /Users/lesliemyint/Desktop/teaching/STAT212/2024_spring/activities/adv_ggplot/sfo_weather.csv\n\nOn a Mac the tilde ~ in a file path refers to the “Home” directory, which is /Users/lesliemyint.

(Not all of them might be able to be investigated with the data source you find for this Milestone—that’s fine.)\nFind one data source, and read that data into R\nThoroughly describe the data context (who, what, when, where, why, and how? questions related to the dataset)\nWrite up a data codebook. That is, describe the type and meaning of the variables in your dataset. Group your variables into categories (e.g., demographic variables, neighborhood variables).\n\nIf you have a lot of variables, it may not be necessary/feasible to describe every variable individually. Rather, you can describe groups of similar variables.\n\nBased on the data context writeup and your codebook, describe which of your 2-3 broad questions can be addressed with your dataset and how.\n\nWrite a plan for addressing these questions. Make sure that the steps in this plan are reasonable to complete in 2 weeks for Milestone 2. You will receive feedback on this plan and will be expected to integrate this feedback for Milestone 2."

    "text": "My philosophy\nGrading is thorny issue for many educators because of its known negative effects on learning and motivation. Nonetheless, it is ever-present in the US education system and at Macalester. Because I am required to submit grades for this course, it’s worth me taking a minute to share my philosophy about grading with you.\nWhat excites me about being a teacher is your learning. Learning flourishes in an environment where you find meaning and value in what we’re exploring, feel safe engaging with challenging things, receive useful feedback, and regularly reflect on your learning.\nIf I didn’t have to give grades, I wouldn’t. But because I am required to, it is important to me to create a course structure and grading system that creates an environment for learning to flourish:\n\nFinding meaning and value: I am striving to achieve this by creating space for authentic connection between you, your peers, and myself and by encouraging you to explore a topic that intrigues you for our course project.\nSafety in engaging with challenges: The assignments and activities that we will use to learn are meant to be challenging, and it would be unreasonable for me to expect that you perform perfectly on the first try. For this reason, every assignment and assessment has an opportunity for unlimited revisions/reattempts without penalty. I hope that this alleviates stress considerably. If ever you are feeling overwhelmed by this course, please reach out to me. We’ll find a way to make things more manageable.\n\nNote: While the number of revisions you can submit is unlimited in theory, in practice, there is a limit to how quickly the preceptors and I can review revisions and give feedback.\n\nReceiving useful feedback and reflecting regularly: In order to learn maximally by pursuing a revision, you need BOTH good feedback and to reflect thoughtfully about misconceptions in your learning. Our preceptors and I will strive to give useful comments and prompts to spur reflection when we see room for improvement. A requirement for submitting a revision is to include a paragraph where you describe and reflect on your prior misconceptions."

    "text": "Assignments and assessments\n\nAsynchronous skills demonstrations\nOur course learning goals will have associated challenges for practicing the tools/concepts. During weekly homework assignments, you will work on one challenge from the most recent class topic as well as the prior class topic. A challenge will either receive a grade of Pass (P) or Not Yet (NY). Requirements for passing will be clearly described in each challenge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkills category\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced ggplot2\nChallenge 1\nChallenge 2\n\n\nSpatial visualization\nChallenge 1\nChallenge 2\n\n\nShiny\nChallenge 1\nChallenge 2\n\n\nData wrangling\nChallenge 1\nChallenge 2\n\n\nModeling and missing data\nChallenge 1\nChallenge 2\n\n\nWriting functions\nChallenge 1\nChallenge 2\n\n\nWriting loops\nChallenge 1\nChallenge 2\n\n\nAPIs\nChallenge 1\nChallenge 2\n\n\nWeb scraping\nChallenge 1\nChallenge 2\n\n\nSQL\nChallenge 1\nChallenge 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurpose\n\n\n\nThe purpose of skills challenges is to engage in targeted and repeated practice for core skills. The reason for interleaving different topics within a single homework assignment is to promote skills becoming more deeply ingrained by spacing out practice over time.\n\n\nRevising and resubmitting challenges: If you receive a grade of NY, you can revise and resubmit your work without penalty as long as you do the following:\n\nWrite a reflection paragraph at the top of your assignment in which you address: What improvements were you asked to make based on feedback on your previous submission? How has reviewing your feedback improved your understanding? (What do you understand better/differently than you did before?)\nSubmit your revised work by issuing another pull request on the GitHub Classroom challenge link.\n\n\n\nIn-person skills sessions\nA skills session (SS) is a discussion that you and I will have about course content. There will be 3 SS’s in the semester (weeks of 2/5, 3/4, and 4/15).\n\nSkills session 1: This session will be very short (5 minutes) and will focus on your fluency with keyboard shortcuts. Sometime during the week of 2/5-2/9 come talk to me to demonstrate your keyboard shortcut usage.\nSkills session 2: This session will be 30 minutes. Schedule this during the week of 3/4-3/8 via Calendly.\nSkills session 3: This session will be 30 minutes. Schedule this during the week of 4/15-4/19 via Calendly.\n\nOne week before the SS, I will provide a set of problems that you can (and should!) work on with peers. During the SS, we will talk through a subset of those problems. I will choose some problems that I’d like you to talk through, and in the time remaining, you will talk through a problem (or part of a problem) of your choosing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurpose\n\n\n\nThe purpose of a SS is to encourage deep and collaborative study and to give us both a detailed understanding of your learning.\n\n\nBefore the SS I will provide a rubric that explains how I will assess your understanding. I will also provide requirements for a grade of Pass (P). If you do not Pass an SS, you will receive a grade of Not Yet (NY).\nRe-attempting a skills session: If you receive a grade of NY, you can re-attempt the SS without penalty as long as you do the following:\n\nSchedule another discussion of the same length as the original SS (via Calendly).\nRevise how you will talk through the problem (or parts of problems) that you struggled with.\nReflect on the following: What improvements were you asked to make based on feedback on your previous submission? How has reviewing your feedback improved your understanding? (What do you understand better/differently than you did before?) Be prepared to tell me about this reflection at the next SS.\n\n\n\nReflections\nRoughly 1, 2, and 3 months into the semester, you will write reflections in which you think about your goals, progress, and next steps. To provide observations that you can draw from in these reflections, I will be asking you to maintain a personal class journal in which you regularly record insights from working on class activities.\nReflections that show thoughtfulness with incorporation of concrete observations from the personal class journal will receive a grade of Pass (P).\nRevising and resubmitting reflections: If your reflection is not yet passing, I will give feedback on some areas for improvement/additional consideration and ask you to resubmit.\n\n\nProject\nThe best way to learn data science and feel like a data scientist is to work on meaningful data-driven projects. The course project will be a semester-long, collaborative experience in which you investigate a series of meaningful questions using multiple datasets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurpose\n\n\n\nThe purpose of the project is to engage in a meaningful and collaborative data-driven experience and to build something that you would be proud to showcase to an employer on your personal website.\n\n\nThrough regular milestones (roughly every 2 weeks) throughout the semester you will set goals for future milestones, make progress on the goals you set out in the previous milestone, and integrate feedback from previous milestones. Details about project milestones and deliverables will be housed on the Project page.\nEach project milestone will receive a grade of Pass (P) or Not Yet (NY) based on the progress made relative to the goals that we agree upon.\nRevising and resubmitting milestones: If you receive a grade of NY, you can revise and resubmit your work without penalty, but it is important that we have a discussion about why goals were not met so that we can plan a reasonable path forward."

In this case, the path becomes ~/Desktop/teaching/STAT212/2023_fall/class_activities/advanced_maps/us_states_hexgrid.geojson\n\nWindows: C:/Users/lesliemyint/Documents/teaching/STAT212/2023_fall/class_activities/advanced_maps/us_states_hexgrid.geojson\n\nNote: Windows uses both / (forward slash) and \\ (backward slash) to separate folders in a file path.\n\n\n\nRelative file paths start wherever you are right now (the working directory (WD)). The WD when you’re working in a code file may be different from the working directory in the Console.\nDirectory setup 1: Data is in same folder as code file\n\nsome_folder\n\nyour_code_file.qmd\ndata.csv\n\n\nThere are two options for the relative path:\n\n./data.csv (The ./ refers to the current working directory.)\ndata.csv\n\nDirectory setup 2: Data is within a subfolder called data\n\nsome_folder\n\nyour_code_file.qmd\ndata\n\ndata.csv\n\n\n\nThe relative path would be data/data.csv. (Note: ./data/data.csv would also work.)\nDirectory setup 3: Need to go to a “parent” folder first to get to the data\n\nsome_folder\n\ndata.csv\ncode\n\nyour_code_file.qmd\n\n\n\nTo go “up” a folder in a relative path we use ../.\nThe relative path here would be ../data.csv.\n\n\n\nIn 03-adv-maps.qmd, navigate to the code chunk where you read in us_states_hexgrid.geojson, apportionment.csv, shp_loc_pop_centers, and shp_water_lakes_rivers.\nUpdate the file paths to correctly find the data in the new directory structure."
