# Purpose

Get really good with keyboard shortcuts for two main reasons:

- Using shortcuts saves a ton of time
- It feels really cool!

# Task

- Review and practice all shortcuts described [here](https://lmyint.github.io/IntermediateDataSciNotes/keyboard.html).
- During our in-person skills session (week of 2/5-2/9), I will ask you to demonstrate your ability to use most of these shortcuts within a roughly 5 minute span.

# Requirements for passing

You will Pass this Skills Session if you can do all of the commands I ask without using your mouse.

If you forget a few shortcuts, it's ok! Just write down the ones you missed and show them to me the next day.
