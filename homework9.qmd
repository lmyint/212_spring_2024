## Homework 9 - Challenge 2

The [SQL Murder Mystery](https://mystery.knightlab.com/walkthrough.html) is a game-based way to learn and practice SQL. The activity starts with a discussion of relational databases and SQL, and it ends with the application of those concepts to solve a murder mystery!

As you work through the mystery, record the SQL queries you use.

Put your response for the name of the killer(s) below:
