# Optional

If you are aiming for an A in the course, recall from our [syllabus](syllabus.qmd#requirements-for-an-a) that participating in 5 Tidy Tuesday challenges can move you toward this goal.

- For further all-around practice, I encourage you to participate in the most recent [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2024/2024-02-06/readme.md) challenge.
